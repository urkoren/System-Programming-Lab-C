A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. 
It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[8] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. 
It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[9][10] with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. 
The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language.
[11][1] C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
