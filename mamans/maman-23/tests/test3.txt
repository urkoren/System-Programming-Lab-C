It’s easy to read. 
Python code uses English keywords rather than punctuation, and its line breaks help define the code blocks. 

In practice, 
this means you can identify what the code is designed to do simply by looking at it.

It’s open source. 
You can download the source code, modify it, and use it however you want.

It’s portable. 
Some languages require you to modify code to run on different platforms, 
but Python is a cross-platform language, 
which means you can run the same code on any operating system with a Python interpreter.

It’s extendable. 
Python code can be written in other languages (such as C++), 
and users can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter to customize and optimize their tools.

It has a broad standard library. 
This library is available for anyone to access and means that users don’t have to write code for every single function—they can access built-in modules that help with issues in everyday programming and more.
